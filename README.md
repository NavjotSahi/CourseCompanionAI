# AI-Powered Academic Dashboard & Course-Specific Chatbot 🎓🤖

A full-stack educational platform that combines a personalized student dashboard with a course-specific chatbot powered by Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and generative AI. Built to enhance learning through real-time academic tracking and intelligent, document-grounded interactions.

## 🔍 Overview

This project integrates:
- 📊 **Student Dashboard**: Visualizes grades, assignments, and course progress in real time.
- 💬 **RAG-based Chatbot**: Answers academic queries using course-specific materials uploaded by instructors.
- 🔐 **Role-Based Access**: Secure login system for students, instructors, and admins with JWT authentication.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) for interactive dashboards and chatbot UI
- **Backend**: [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) for APIs and user management
- **AI Orchestration**: [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) + [Google Gemini](https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (for academic data), ChromaDB (for vector embeddings)
- **Auth**: JSON Web Tokens (JWT), Role-based access (students/teachers/admins)

## ✨ Features

- 📚 Instructor upload portal for course materials (PDF, DOCX, TXT)
- 🧠 Chatbot grounded in course content using vector search + RAG
- 🔒 Secure login with custom user roles
- 📈 Dashboard with student performance and deadline tracking
- 💬 Real-time academic Q&A with citation-backed responses
